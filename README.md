# PCC-Robotics-Project
- Developing a part-humanoid robot using the Arduino platform, to greet anyone in its vicinity (Range: 1.5m)
- Uses Arduino and Adafruit Components
- Uses HC-SR04 ultrasonic distance sensor for detecting people in its vicinity
- Uses Adafruit Wave Shield for 'speech' / 'greetings' generation
- Final version made sustainable by using a solar-powered battery pack (5V 30000mAh Li-ion) to power the robot
